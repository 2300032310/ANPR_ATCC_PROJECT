# ANPR + ATCC Detection System

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a combined **Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)** and **Automatic Traffic Count & Classification (ATCC)** system.  
The system processes real-time or recorded traffic footage to:

- Detect vehicles  
- Extract license plates  
- Recognize plate numbers using OCR  
- Count and classify vehicles into categories  

This project uses Python along with OpenCV, EasyOCR, and YOLO-based detection models.  
ANPR + ATCC aims to revolutionize intelligent traffic monitoring by merging AI-powered vision, automation, and real-time analytics into one unified platform — contributing toward smarter, safer, and more efficient cities.

## Future Work & Roadmap

- **Multi-language OCR support:** Expand beyond English plates using PaddleOCR and custom models.  
- **Integration with Registration APIs:** Verify extracted plates with official databases for real-time alerts.  
- **Edge Device Deployment:** Optimize models for Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi, and embedded cameras.  
- **Cloud Sync & Visualization:** Deploy traffic dashboards on AWS/GCP/Azure.  
- **Enhanced UI/UX:** Add dark mode, user profiles, notifications, and mobile responsiveness.  
- **Expanded Vehicle Classification:** Include electric scooters, buses, emergency vehicles, and non-motorized entities.  
- **AI Model Improvements:** Experiment with transformer-based detectors for superior accuracy.
